Description:

   AMD is a set of routines for pre-ordering sparse matrices prior to
   Cholesky or LU factorization, using the approximate minimum degree

All files in src/libglpk/colamd are taken from or based on:

COLAMD/SYMAMD Version 2.7, Copyright (C) 1998-2007, Timothy A. Davis,
All Rights Reserved.

Description:

   colamd:  an approximate minimum degree column ordering algorithm,
            for LU factorization of symmetric or unsymmetric matrices,
            QR factorization, least squares, interior point methods for
            linear programming problems, and other related problems.

   symamd:  an approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm for
            Cholesky factorization of symmetric matrices.

Purpose:

   Colamd computes a permutation Q such that the Cholesky factorization
   of (AQ)'(AQ) has less fill-in and requires fewer floating point
   operations than A'A.  This also provides a good ordering for sparse
   partial pivoting methods, P(AQ) = LU, where Q is computed prior to
   numerical factorization, and P is computed during numerical
   factorization via conventional partial pivoting with row
   interchanges.  Colamd is the column ordering method used in SuperLU,
   part of the ScaLAPACK library.  It is also available as built-in
   function in MATLAB Version 6, available from MathWorks, Inc.
   (http://www.mathworks.com).  This routine can be used in place of
   colmmd in MATLAB.

   Symamd computes a permutation P of a symmetric matrix A such that
   the Cholesky factorization of PAP' has less fill-in and requires
   fewer floating point operations than A.  Symamd constructs a matrix
   M such that M'M has the same nonzero pattern of A, and then orders
   the columns of M using colmmd.  The column ordering of M is then
   returned as the row and column ordering P of A.

Authors:

   The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy A.
   Davis (davis at cise.ufl.edu), University of Florida.  The algorithm
   was developed in collaboration with John Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and
   Esmond Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

MiniSat-C v1.14.1
========================================

* Fixed some serious bugs.
* Tweaked to be Visual Studio friendly (by Alan Mishchenko).
  This disabled reading of gzipped DIMACS files and signal handling,
  but none of these features are essential (and easy to re-enable, if
  wanted).

MiniSat-C v1.14
========================================

Ok, we get it. You hate C++. You hate templates. We agree; C++ is a
seriously messed up language. Although we are more pragmatic about the
quirks and maldesigns in C++, we sympathize with you. So here is a
pure C version of MiniSat, put together by Niklas Sorensson.
