Description: Tukey regions are polytopes in the Euclidean space, viz. 
    upper-level sets of the Tukey depth function on given data. The bordering 
    hyperplanes of a Tukey region are computed as well as its vertices, facets, 
    centroid, and volume. In addition, the Tukey median set, which is the 
    non-empty Tukey region having highest depth level, and its barycenter 
    (= Tukey median) are calculated. Tukey regions are visualized in dimension 
    two and three. For details see Liu, Mosler, and Mozharovskyi 
    (2019, <doi:10.1080/10618600.2018.1546595>). See file LICENSE.note for
