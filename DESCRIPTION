Description: Tukey regions are polytopes in the Euclidean space, viz. upper-level sets of the Tukey depth function on given data. The bordering hyperplanes of a Tukey region are computed as well as its vertices, facets, centroid, and volume. In addition, the Tukey median set, which is the non-empty Tukey region having highest depth level, and its barycenter (= Tukey median) are calculated. Tukey regions are visualized in dimension two and three. For details see Liu, Mosler, and Mozharovskyi (2017) <arXiv:1412.5122>.
